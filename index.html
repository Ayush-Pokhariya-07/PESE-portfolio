                            and Engineering student who believes in growing both
                            technically and personally. While I continue
                            building a solid foundation in programming, web
                            development, and problem-solving, I have also come
                            to realize the importance of communication,
                            confidence, and adaptability in the professional

                            to write better code - I am learning how to present

                            effectively, and grow into a well-rounded individual

                    <p>
                        When I filled out my personal profiling sheet, I became
                        much clear about my career goals and got much clear
                        about my strengths and weaknesses.Like I came to know
                        that I aim to master algorithms and software development
                        through hands-on projects, particularly in areas like
                        cybersecurity, which fascinates me. Engineering chose me
                        more than I chose it—I love the creative process of
                        designing solutions and the thrill of turning ideas into
                        reality.

                    <p>
                        In this session i discovered that there audience can be
                        filled with various kind of people like some who are
                        visual learner or the one who are auditory learners. I
                        also discovered that I learn best through a mix of
                        modes: I am visually oriented (like I sketch flowcharts
                        to understand algorithms while solving some coding
                        problem), audibly receptive (I remember concepts better
                        when I explain them to some of my friends), and
                        kinesthetic—hands-on practice cements my learning.
                        Recognising this, I now balance diagrams, discussions,
                        and coding exercises in every study session.

                    <p>
                        This movie is an inspiring story based on the real-life
                        journey of Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman who
                        faces homelessness while trying to build a better future
                        for his son. The movie follows his hardships,
                        determination, and relentless pursuit of success against
                        all odds. <br />

                        “Her stillness defeated his storm.”, In the film, this
                        line refers to the moment Chris Gardner recalls how his
                        mother sat utterly motionless—eyes fixed on her
                        newspaper—so still that his stepfathers rage simply ran
                        out of steam against her, showing how calm endurance can
                        disarm even the fiercest outburst.

                    <p>
                        In these sessions, I learned how important our body
                        language is during any presentation or conversation. I
                        try to keep a straight posture, make eye contact (even
                        with the camera when recording), and use hand movements
                        to explain things better. I also practiced speaking
                        clearly, changing my tone and speed when needed, and
                        taking small pauses so people can understand my points
                        better. Others can learn how to feel more confident
                        while speaking and how small things like posture and
                        voice can make a big difference.

                    <p>
                        in this session i learned about how to give an effective
                        presentation like instead of just telling the facts or
                        speaking like a robot we can be much expressive like
                        with the help of body language, eye contact, facial
                        expressions, content clarity and storytelling etc. I
                        storyboard with hook, agenda, core content, and
                        takeaway, rehearse with timing, record delivery, and use
                        minimal transitions for clarity.

                        During this session we learned about writing effective
                        mails, resume etc. I follow “PIE” for emails (Purpose,
                        Information, End) and STAR for resumes (Situation, Task,
                        Action, Result) to drive clear action and highlight

                    <p>
                        In GD practice, I tried different roles like being the
                        moderator, giving ideas, and summarizing the discussion.
                        I learned how to listen properly, respect others’
                        opinions, and speak up at the right time. I also try to
                        bring the group back on track if we go off-topic. Others
                        can learn how to work better in a team, speak with
                        confidence, and make sure everyone’s voice is heard. I
                        rotate as moderator, contributor, and summarizer—setting
                        ground rules, paraphrasing, and summarizing to foster
                        inclusive, goal-oriented discussion.
